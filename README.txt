# Text Reverser App

A simple app that reverses text. This was a quick app that I was asked to create for an interview. I used grid to accomplish the responsive box effect. The UI was inspired by Google Translate. 

## Project Requirements: 
- [x] Allows the user to input a string between 2 and 300 characters
- [x] Displays the entire input string in an input area on the page so all input text is visible.
- [X] Reverse the entire string, Example ‘The dog was fast’ becomes ‘tsaf saw god ehT’ 
- [x] Displays the entire output string in an output area on the page so all output text is visible.
- [X] You can reverse with each character entered or onsubmit. 
- [x] Have a way to clear/reset the page to allow the user to start over. 
- [x] Add instructions on the page which describe:
    - What the page does.
    - What you want the user to do.
    - Handle errors
- [x] Again, all code, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should be inline. 

## Additional Features:
- Responsive page
- Notification alert and animation at 1 & 300 characters
- Fade out animation when resetting 
- Added character counter activated by typing and pasting
